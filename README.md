ðŸŽ¯ Two Methods, One Result: Encoding Categorical Variables
In this notebook, we demonstrate two different methods to convert categorical variables into numerical form, both resulting in the same output format known as one-hot encoded variables:

Using pandas.get_dummies()
This is the most straightforward and commonly used method in pandas for quickly converting categorical columns into dummy/one-hot encoded variables.

python
Copy
Edit
pd.get_dummies(df['Category'])
Using OneHotEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing
A more flexible method suitable for pipelines and machine learning workflows. Itâ€™s especially useful when working with scikit-learn models.

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
encoded = encoder.fit_transform(df[['Category']])
âœ… Both methods yield the same outcome: they transform categorical variables into a set of binary (0 or 1) columns, enabling machine learning models to interpret and process the data effectively.
